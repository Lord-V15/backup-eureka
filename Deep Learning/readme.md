# Artificial Neural Networks & Deep Learning

### Deep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.

Contains work on Supervised Learning using Keras.

I believe Deep learning is a subset of AI and machine learning that uses multi-layered artificial neural networks to deliver state-of-the-art accuracy in tasks such as object detection, speech recognition, language translation and others.

You will see a lot of Keras being used, without the dependencies of TensorFlow.
If you are accustomed to PyTorch, I wish you all the best in trying to understand this.
